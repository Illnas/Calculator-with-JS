Calculator with JS

Well, I did it. And it feels mighty awesome! Why? Because I managed to finish this project in one day!!!

And that's to include I did research and repeated lessons I learned from Algebra education!
Now, I do feel like I could have done this little bit better! But, there is still room for
improvement. Does this Calculator work? Yep!

Well, next JS project is tip calculator, which is not that hard to do, will try to do it 
differently than this one though. And I need to figure out logic in which my Tetris React project will
do it's magic, but I am in no hurry ;)

Onwards to another project!!!!
